# Summary

Stars play host to exotic environments that cannot be simulated in terrestrial
laboratories. The focus of this work is neutron stars, thought to be the most
compact extended objects in the Universe. Observable radiation from a neutron
star encodes information about fundamental physics: gravity, electromagnetism,
and nuclear forces. Neutron stars are often detected by astronomers because
their radiative signal stably pulses due to bulk stellar rotation. For example,
*pulsars* are typically detected in sky surveys because they stably pulse at
radio wavelengths, akin to lighthouses in a dark ocean.

Neutron star are also detected if they contribute to the generation of some
bright transient signal generated by some catastrophic or non-catastrophic
event. An example of the former would be destruction of the neutron star upon
merging with another compact object, generating detectable gravitational wave
and/or electromagnetic signals. An example of the latter would be a radiation
burst driven by accretion of matter from a binary companion.

By modeling the physical process that generates data observed by telescopes,
astronomers and astrostatisticians make inferential statements about the nature
of the Universe at its very seams.

# Statement of need

There exist open-source libraries and packages to support a subset of the
modeling treated in astrophysical literature. They provide frameworks, toolsets,
model implementations, and so on. One sub-field for which there does not exist
an open-source project for the statistical modeling of X-ray signals that pulse
due to rotational modulation of asymmetric emission from the surface of a
neutron star. Pulsing X-ray signals from neutron stars are analyzed to
statistically estimate parameters such as stellar mass and radius. Such
parameter estimation requires relativistic ray-tracing of radiation as it
propagates from surface to a distant telescope.

Likelihood information about the mass and radius of a given neutron star is
utilized in an array of contexts. A pertinent example is post-processing of the
likelihood into information about the equation of state of cold dense matter
inside neutron stars. Contemporary and future telescopes are and will take aim
at these pulsing stars: the apt example is the NICER (Neutron star Interior
Composition ExploreR) X-ray telescope, a NASA payload installed on the
International Space Station.

X-PSI is an open-source Python package for Bayesian modeling of time- and
energy-resolved X-ray pulsations. X-PSI provides a framework for the
implementation of custom models (likelihood and prior functions) and their
coupling to open-source statistical sampling software for use on
high-performance computing systems. Notably, X-PSI has and is being implemented
by the NICER collaboration for pulse-profile modeling of rotation-powered
millisecond pulsars.

The numerical likelihood routines native to X-PSI are written in Cython, and
are dependent on the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). High-level object-oriented
model construction is performed by a user in the Python language, as is the
interfacing with sampling software. Low-level customisation is encouraged in the
extensions (either directly in Cython or via calls to external C libraries).
X-PSI is Unix source code compatible, and release versions are freely available
on GitHub under the MIT license.
